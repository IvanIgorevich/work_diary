When the "Change Stage" button on the deal profile page is clicked to change the deal stage to "Funded," it opens the "Closing Schedule" page.

This page corresponds to the RealEstate::Closing#new model. If all the fields are filled in correctly, all validations pass successfully, and the model instance is saved, then and only then the deal stage will change to "Funded."

On this page, there are 6 fillable fields: Short Interest, Appraisal & Feasibility Fees, Flood Certification, Servicing Fees, Wire Fees, and Other Costs. There is also a "Total Closing Costs" field that sums up all the filled fields in the Stimulus controller. The "Amount to Disburse" field calculates the difference between the Total Loan Amount and Total Closing Costs. The Construction Escrow and Total Loan Amount fields contain corresponding data from the deal budget.

There is a "Send by Email" checkbox on the page. It is active if the deal has an issuer; otherwise, there is a link next to it to edit the deal and add an issuer. When the checkbox is checked, the wire info for the deal's issuer is displayed below using Stimulus. If the issuer does not have wire info, a modal window with a form for creating wire info for the issuer of the deal appears through Turbo Stream. After submitting the form, the wire info appears on the page via Turbo Stream and is hidden or shown when the "Send by Email" checkbox is checked.

Below are two file upload fields: HUD/Closing Statement and Wire instructions. After submitting the form in the Closings controller, corresponding Common::Documents are created for the deal. Under each file field, there is a "Attach to email?" checkbox. If it is checked, the file is attached to the SentEmail model instance, which is polymorphically associated with RealEstate::Closing.

In the Closings controller, an instance of the SentEmail model is created. For this purpose, there is a special EmailNotification model that users can edit through the admin interface. Fields like :to, :cc, :bcc, and :body are copied from EmailNotification to SentEmail. In the :body field, the EmailNotification :template field is populated after processing in a special generator. Special tokens, such as {BANK_NAME}, are replaced with corresponding information from the deal or from the newly filled RealEstate::Closing entity. The :from field is set to the email of the current user, and the :subject is set to "deal name - Funding Wire Request."

If the "Send by Email" checkbox is checked, after submitting the form, it redirects to the SentEmail#edit page. This page allows for editing the model fields and displays links to files if they are saved in the deal as Common::Documents and marked as attached to the email through checkboxes. After submitting this form, an email is created and sent with fields corresponding to the SentEmail fields. The deal page opens with a message "Email sent successfully." The secondary menu item "Payment Schedule" gains a dropdown with a link to "Closing Costs," leading to the RealEstate::Closing#show page.

The entire functionality is covered by tests.

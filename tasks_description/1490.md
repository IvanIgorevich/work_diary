Enhancement of Credit Line Functionality

In the Common::PropertyType model, which contains property types the company deals with, the fields :max_adv_rate, :max_ltv, :display_on have been added. The first two are for storing the corresponding percentages. The last field, :display_on, utilizes the active_flag gem to allow selecting one or more values from possible options, namely :deal_profile, :credit_line. In the Common::PropertyType#index page, which displays a table of all property types with editing capabilities and a row for adding new ones, columns for the new fields have been incorporated. Notably, separate columns for each value of :display_on, containing checkboxes with custom autosaving through Stimulus, as the standard Stimulus-autosave didn't suit the purpose.

A reversible migration was created to introduce missing property types, renaming some, and assigning values for :max_adv_rate, :max_ltv. The necessary :display_on values were set for all property types. Other changes can be made by users through the admin interface on the aforementioned Common::PropertyType#index page.

Now, property types with the :deal_profile value in the :display_on field are displayed in the property type selector on the deal editing page.

Property types with the :credit_line value in the :display_on field are used for creating credit lines in the Common::BusinessEntity model, where companies our company collaborates with are stored. On the BusinessEntity page, there's an "Add Credit Line" button to create a credit line, which is stored in the Common::CreditLine model. Clicking this button opens a page for creating this model, including fields for various credit line parameters for this company and a table for specifying on which :max_ltv metrics for which property types the company is willing to extend credit lines, along with the percentage it's willing to contribute (:max_adv_rate). This data is stored in the Common::LendingTerm model. When the "Add Credit Line" button is pressed, property types with the :credit_line value in the :display_on field are selected from the array of all property types, and based on this selection, Common::LendingTerms are created and associated with Common::CreditLine. Specific values for :max_adv_rate and :max_ltv can be later modified on the credit line creation or editing page.

In the Capital Source section on the deal profile page, a line "Leverage Qualification Check" has been added, accompanied by a table displaying all companies (Common::BusinessEntity) that meet the following criteria:
1. Available to Draw credit line value is greater than zero.
2. Deal property type is present in the credit line property type titles of the company.
3. The deal's LTV value is less than the :max_ltv value in the corresponding Common::LendingTerm of the credit line whose name matches the deal's property type.
This table includes the company name and a "Max Available Leverage" column, which calculates the percentage of invested funds in the deal, stored in the :max_adv_rate field of the matching Common::LendingTerm.

The entire functionality is covered by tests, and unique non-repetitive values from predefined arrays have been added to certain factories for specific fields.
